C++ projects for the botnet simulator.

"simbo" is the main simulation library. "test_* projects contain tests for different parts of the codebase. "test_simbo" is the unit test project for "simbo".

"configuration_demo" is a small program which loads the config (example in configuration_demo/resources/config.json) and sets up the simulation.

"botnet_simulation" is the main executable which should be built in release mode and used to run simulations.
